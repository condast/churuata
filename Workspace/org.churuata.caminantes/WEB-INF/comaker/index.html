        <h1 class="section-title">What do we do?</h1>
        <p>Refugiados Unidos is itself an RLO that is able to fund other RLO's, thanks to donations from people who want
          their money to help the people who really need it, and want to minimise the costs of overhead of large NGO's.
          They proposed an online platform, the _churuata digital_, that aims to inform refugees about possible help in
          their immediate area, but which at the same time allows every RLO to become an information hub of other
          possible forms of aid that they could get. A refugee is usually not really helped with an occasional meal or a
          band-aid, if other needs are not addressed as well. Churuata Digital aims to present an immediate overview of
          relevant aid that especially refugee families can find in the vicinity. As most families do have a mobile
          phone, the platform should be simple, and optimised for mobile use.
          In february 2022, just when the _Million Dollar Challenge_ was published, Condast as able to offer the
          Churuata Digital as a project to three second-year students ICT at the Windesheim University of Applied
          Science in Almere, the Netherlands. They have been working on the platform ever since, and will keep on doing
          so until the end of the school term. The aim is to develop a demonstrator, that can be used as a base for an
          actual platform for refugees. The source code is made available under an Apache 2 open source license.
          Because of organisational issues, Refugiados Unidos is not the principal owner of the platform, but is part of
          the creative process. When the Ukrainian War broke out, it was decided to design the platform for this group,
          as most Venezuelan refugees have currently settled, and are no longer on the move.</p>

          <h2>Main reason</h2>
          <p>The main reason why this application, despite its apparent simplicity, needs a graph database, is because
            of the enormous differentiation of services that can be offered, and which is difficult to implement in a
            tradional SQL database.</p>

          <div class="icon"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/bubbles/100/000000/services.png" /></div>
          <h2>Example</h2>
          <p>For instance, even a simple service, such as food may have to be expanded, such as food -> fruit, if a
            refugee is passing through a region where pineapples are grown, and there is a likelihood that many RLO's
            are offering the same fruit. </p>

          <div class="icon"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/bubbles/100/000000/services.png" /></div>
          <h2>Example</h2>
          <p>For instance, a family may require a different form of shelter than someone travelling alone. Pairing
            refugees to available services poses a well-known fundamental problem of matching, that we eventually want
            to address with machine-learning algorithms.</p>
