<P LANG="en-GB">Modified 05 September 2018</P>
<H3 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Our privacy obligations</H3>
<P><SPAN LANG="en-GB">This is the Privacy Policy for Centre of Expertise RDM, an
organisation affiliated to the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences,
having its registered office at Heijplaatstraat 23, 3089 JB, Rotterdam, the Netherlands after referred to
as &lsquo;COE-RDM&rsquo;.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-GB">This Policy sets out how the Centre of Expertise RDM (COE-RDM) uses and protects
any personal data that you provide to COE-RDM (including personal
data provided through the website <A HREF="http://www.rdmcoe.nl//">www.rdmcoe.nl/</A>
and affiliated websites). We are committed to protecting your
personal data and only using it for the purpose for which is was
originally supplied. This policy is a live document and as COE-RDM
continues to adhere to data protection legislation, this policy will
be updated accordingly.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">COE-RDM is governed by European and Dutch legislation
regarding the Privacy Principles (PPs). The PPs regulate how personal
information is handled by COE-RDM. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">'Personal information' means information or an
opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is
reasonably identifiable. COE-RDM's Privacy Policy applies to personal
information collected and/or held by COE-RDM. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">This Privacy Policy also explains how we process
'personal data' about people in the European Union (EU), as required
under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">We will review this policy regularly, and we may
update it from time to time. 
</P>
<H3 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">What we Do</H3>
<P>COE-RDM develops software solutions for our clients. These clients
may process personal data, which are governed  by their own privacy
policies. A number of products that COE-RDM develops on their own
terms may collect personal data in order to support them. COE-RDM
will also collect data about individuals from companies who express
an interest in COE-RDM&rsquo;s products and services. COE-RDM does
not and will not share personal data with third party companies.</P>
<P><U>How we collect data and what we do with it</U></P>
<P>COE-RDM maintains a record of your name and email address as a
minimum. Other data (if provided by the individual with consent) can
include company name, company address and telephone number.</P>
<P>The data we gather is held under the premise of consent and is
collected by COE-RDM directly as a result of your direct contact with
us via one of the following means:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Signing up to receive our

you up to date with COE-RDM. By consenting to COE-RDM holding your
personal data we will send you our monthly newsletter. Individuals
can unsubscribe at any time using the link at the bottom of each of
our emails.</P>
<P><U>How we protect and store your data</U></P>
<P>Your information is only available to sales and marketing
personnel within COE-RDM.</P>
<P>Your information is held on our local NAS Server. This NAS server
requires authentication credentials in order to login.</P>
<P><U>Your rights</U></P>
<P>You have rights regarding your personal data. This includes seeing
the data that we hold on you and updating your information. You can
request a copy of your information that we store or ask for it to be
deleted by contacting <A HREF="mailto:sales@asvglobal.com">rdmcoe@hr.nl</A>;
you can also unsubscribe from our mailing list <A HREF="https://asvglobal.us7.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=46273c6e0cff5cee704b2a8a1&amp;id=960a2257a7">here</A>.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">The types of personal information we
collect and hold</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">The COE-RDM vision regarding privacy can be
summarised with &ldquo;Your data is your own&rdquo;. COE-RDM has no
interest to collect and analyse personal information, and has no
commercial interest in doing so. Personal information can be
collected by our clients, and we may have access to this data.
Normally we mainly work with 'dummy' data, which are articially
generated and have no relationship with real people. In the rare
cases that we do access personal information, it only serves to test
the applications we develop for our clients. Under certain
circumstances we may need to export this data internally for testing.
We have a NAS Server for this purpose that is protected with
authentication credentials, and we do not aim to keep the exported
data longer than is strictly necessary for these testing purposes.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">Proprietary software that is developed by COE-RDM by
large consists of so-called P2P connectivity, which ensures that
personal information is only available on the user's PC, tablet or
smart phone. If a possibility is included to synchronize this data on
a cloud server, then it will be encrypted with credentials provided
by the user, so that COE-RDM cannot access this data without specific
consent from that user. This consent will only be required to restore
this data to the user, for instance after a malfunction of the
computer. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">Not all information requested, collected, and
processed by us is &quot;Personal Information&quot; as it does not
identify you as a specific natural person. This will include majority
of &quot;User Generated Content&quot; that you provide us with the
intention of sharing with other users. Such &quot;Non-Personal
Information&quot; is not covered by this privacy policy. However, as
non-personal information may be used in aggregate or be linked with
existing personal information; when in this form it will be treated
as personal information. As such, this privacy policy will list both
types of information for the sake of transparency. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">In some situations, users may provide us with
personal information without us asking for it, or through means not
intended for the collection of particular types of information.
Whilst we may take reasonable steps to protect this data, the user
will have bypassed our systems, processes, and control and thus the
information provided will not be governed by this privacy policy. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">In some situations users may provide us personal
information over platforms that are outside our control; for example
through social media or forums. Whilst any information collected by
us is governed by this Privacy Policy, the platform by which it was
communicated will be governed by its own Privacy Policy. 
</P>
<H3 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">How we collect personal information</H3>
<H4 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Information that you specifically
give us</H4>
<P LANG="en-GB">While you use our products and services you may be
asked to provide certain types of personal information. This might
happen through our website, applications, online chat systems,
telephone, paper forms, or in-person meetings. We will give you a
Collection Notice at the time, to explain how we will use the
personal information we are asking for. The notice may be written or
in digital form.

use our service</H4>
<P LANG="en-GB">Although it is the policy of COE-RDM not to collect
personal data, certain products in the foreseeable future may require
another approach. For these products we may maintain records of the
interactions we have with our users, including the products, services
and customer support we have provided. This includes the interactions
our users have with our platform such as when a user has viewed a
page or clicked a button. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">In order to deliver certain products or services we
may passively collect your GPS coordinates, where available from your
device. Most modern devices such as smartphones will display a
permission request when our platform requests this data.

we are contacted via email, we will collect the email address used.

you to examine the terms and conditions of using that website and its
privacy policy.

<H3 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">How we use personal information</H3>

</UL>
<P LANG="en-GB">We use automated decision algorithms to match users
and decide mutual interests. The primary way this occurs is through
how we rank users. These rankings are produced by analysing user
generated content, and user activity. Generally speaking, these
algorithms will work locally on the user's computer, and generalised,
anonymised profiles will be shared. More information on these ranking
guides can be found in our community articles. Automated decision
making is also used to make recommendations.

information</H3>
<H4 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Our third party service providers</H4>
<P LANG="en-GB">The personal information of users will not be shared

<P LANG="en-GB">Through the API's developed by COE-RDM it may be
possible for users to grant third party applications access to their
COE-RDM account. Depending on the permissions that are granted, these
applications may be able to access some personal information or do
actions on the users' behalf. These third party applications are not
controlled by us and will be governed by their own privacy policy.
Users are able to remove third party applications from access their
data through their settings. 
</P>
<H4 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Other disclosures and transfers</H4>
<P LANG="en-GB">We may also disclose your personal information to
third parties for the following purposes:

downloading your personal information</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">In league with our primary position on personal data,
you have the right to access to personal information that is stored
on your local computer on behalf of COE-RDM products. This will
always be possible by providing a username and password. If we store
this information on our cloud servers, it will be encrypted and
solely used to retrieve the credentials if this is required. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">Unless an exception applies, we must allow you to see
the personal information we hold about you, within a reasonable time
period, and without unreasonable expense for no charge. Most personal
information can be accessed by logging into your account. If you wish
to access information that is not accessible through the platform, or
wish to download all personal information we hold on you in a
portable data format, please contact our Privacy Officer. 
</P>

require assistance please contact our customer support. 
</P>
<H3 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Exercising your other rights</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB">You have a number of other rights in relation to the
personal data COE-RDM holds about you, however, there may be
restrictions on how you may exercise the rights. This is largely due
to the nature of the products and services we provide. Much of the
data we collect is in order to facilitate contracts between users,
facilitate payments, and provide protection for the legitimate users
of our marketplace - these data uses are protected against the below
rights. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB">You have the right to:

</UL>
<P LANG="en-GB"><B>Human review of automated decision making /
profiling</B> - In the case of our ranking algorithms, it is not
possible to exercise this right as this ranking is a fundamental part
of the marketplace that users participate in, opting out would mean
not being able to participate in the marketplace. Decisions affecting
marketplace security are already reviewed by humans. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB"><B>Direct marketing and profiling</B> &ndash; COE-RDM
does not use personal data for purposes of direct marketing. We do
use profiling algorithms, but these operate in your local
environment, and are intended to advise you on things of interest.
Marketing tools may present themselves in your local application
environment, based on these profiles, but will adhere to the same
rules of other forms of interaction with other users. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB"><B>Erasure</B> - Most personal information and user
generated content can be deleted. In exceptional cases it may not be
possible to do so, such as when they are used to support contracts
between users, document financial transactions, and are used in
providing protecting other legitimate users of the marketplace. In
the case of non-personal data that can be linked with personal data,
it will either be erased or otherwise anonymised from the personal
data.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB"><B>Temporary restriction to processing</B> - under
certain circumstances you may exercise this right, in particular if
you believe that the personal data we have is not accurate, or you
believe that we do not have legitimate grounds for processing your
information. In either case you may exercise this right by contacting
our privacy officer.

above rights by contacting our Privacy Officer.
