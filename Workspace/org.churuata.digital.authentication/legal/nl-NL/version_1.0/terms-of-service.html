    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Our_Terms_of_Use">Our Terms of Service</span></h2>
    Welcome to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wojvUc5gTg">${product}</a>!
    The ${product} (â€œweâ€� or â€œusâ€�), is aimed to empower and engage people around the
    world to develop ${product.description} and share their experiences&nbsp; under
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Free_content" class="extiw" title="w:en:Free content">free
      license</a> or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and
    globally, free of charge.
    <p>To support our community, we provide the essential infrastructure and
      organizational framework for the development of autonomous&nbsp; vessels
      and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep
      educational and informational content from the Projects available on the
      internet free of charge, in perpetuity.
    </p>
    <p>We welcome you (â€œyouâ€� or the â€œuserâ€�) as a reader, editor, author, or
      contributor of the ${product} Projects, and we encourage you to join the
      ${product} community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please
      read and agree to the following Terms of Service (â€œTerms of Serviceâ€�).
    </p>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service tell you about our public services at the ${product}
      Client, our relationship to you as a user, and the rights and
      responsibilities that guide us both. We want you to know that we host
      educational and informational content, all of which is contributed and
      made possible by users like yourself. Generally we do not contribute,
      monitor, or delete content (with the rare exception of policies like these
      Terms of Service or legal compliance for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act"

        class="extiw" title="w:en:Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</a>
      notices). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and
      your fellow users who create and manage the content. We merely host this
      content.
    </p>
    <p>The community â€“ the network of users who are constantly building and
      using the various sites or Projects â€“ are the principal means through
      which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to
      and helps govern our sites. The community undertakes the critical function
      of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such
      as the different language editions for the ${product} multi-lingual edition).
    </p>
    <p>You are welcome to join as a contributor, editor, or author, but you
      should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project
      editions. The largest of our Projects is the ${product}, but we host other
      Projects too, each with different objectives and work methods. You are
      welcome to join and improve these Projects. Because we are dedicated to
      making content freely accessible to the public, we generally require that
      all content you contribute is available under a free license or in the
      public domain.
    </p>
    <p>Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your
      contributions, edits, and re-use of ${product} content under the laws of the
      European Union and other applicable laws (which may include the laws where
      you live or where you view or edit content). This means it is important
      that you use caution when posting content. In light of this
      responsibility, we have some rules about what you cannot post, most of
      which is either for your own protection or for the protection of other
      users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for
      general informational purposes only, so if you need expert advice for a
      particular question (such as medical, legal, or financial issues), you
      should seek the help of a licensed or qualified professional. We also
      include other important notices and disclaimers, so please read these
      Terms of Service in their entirety.
    </p>
    <p>For clarity, other organizations that may share in the same mission are
      nevertheless legally independent and separate from the ${product} and have no
      responsibility for the operations of the website or its content.

    <p>The ${product} is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and
      distribution of free projects concerning ${product.description} for the public
      free of charge. Our role is to host services relating to this mission.
      However, we act only as a hosting service, maintaining the infrastructure
      and organizational framework that allows our users to build ${product.projects} by contributing and editing content themselves. Because of our
      unique role, there are a couple of things you should be aware of when
      considering our relationship to you, the Projects, and the other users:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <b>We do not take an editorial role:</b> Because the ${product.projects}
        are collaboratively edited, all of the content that we host is provided
        by users like yourself, and we do not take an editorial role. This means
        that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project
        websites, and we do not take any responsibility for this content.
        Similarly, we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services,
        and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or
        reliability of any submitted community content. Instead, we simply
        provide access to the content that your fellow users have contributed
        and edited.</li>
      <li>
        <b>You are responsible for your own actions:</b> You are legally
        responsible for your edits and contributions on ${product.projects}, so
        for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid
        contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability
        under any applicable laws. For clarity, applicable law includes at least
        the laws of the European Union. Although we may not agree with such
        actions, we warn editors and contributors that authorities may seek to
        apply other country laws to you, including local laws where you live or
        where you view or edit content. We can generally cannot offer any
        protection, guarantee, immunity or indemnification.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2._Privacy_Policy">2. Privacy Policy</span></h2>
    <p>We ask that you review the terms of our <a href="${privacy.policy.url}"

        title="Privacy policy">Privacy Policy</a>, so that you are aware of how
      we collect and use your information. Our principal policy is "your data is
      your own". We do not aspire to store, analyse and process personal data
      for commercial use or otherwise. We store minimal personal information to
      ${product.description}. By using our services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside your
      country.

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <b>You may find some material objectionable or erroneous:</b> Because we
        provide a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow
        users, you may encounter material that you find offensive, erroneous,
        misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask
        that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Our content is for general informational purposes only:</b> Our
        content is presented for general informational, educational and
        recreational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional
        advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who
        is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any
        information, opinion, or advice contained in one of the Project

        Refraining from Certain Activities</span></h2>
    <p>The Projects hosted by ${product} only exist because of the vibrant
      community of users like you who collaborate to write, edit, and curate the
      content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We
      encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in
      the community, to act in good faith, and to make edits and contributions
      aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project.
    </p>
    <p>Certain activities, whether legal or illegal, may be harmful to other
      users and violate our rules, and some activities may also subject you to
      liability. Therefore, for your own protection and for that of other users,
      you may not engage in such activities on our sites. These activities

    <p>To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture, all users
      contributing to the Projects are required to grant broad permissions to
      the general public to re-distribute and re-use their contributions freely,
      so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to re-use
      and re-distribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our
      goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience, we
      require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it
      is freely reusable by anyone who cares to access it.
    </p>
    <p>You agree to the following licensing requirements:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

        </ul>
        <p>(Re-users may comply with either license or both.)</p>
        <p>The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a
          different license. In that case, you agree to license any text you
          contribute under that particular license.
        </p>
        <p>Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your
          contributions, as long as such uses are compliant with the terms.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Attribution:</b> Attribution is an important part of these
        licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due â€“ to authors
        like yourself. When you contribute text, you agree to be attributed in
        any of the following fashions:
        <ol style="list-style:lower-roman">
          <li>
            Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which
            you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists
            all authors and editors);</li>
          <li>
            Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable
            online copy that is freely accessible, which conforms with the
            license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner
            equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or</li>
          <li>
            Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of
            authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant
            contributions).</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Importing text:</b> You may import text that you have found elsewhere
        or that you have co-authored with others, but in such case you warrant
        that the text is available under terms that are compatible with the CC
        BY-SA 3.0 license (or, as explained above, another license when
        exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature)("CC BY-SA").
        Content available only under GFDL is not permissible.
        <p>You agree that, if you import text under a CC BY-SA license that
          requires attribution, you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable
          fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories
          (such as ${product}-internal copying), it is sufficient to give
          attribution in the edit summary, which is recorded in the page
          history, when importing the text. The attribution requirements are
          sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of
          the license), and there may be instances where the ${product} community
          decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Non-text media:</b> Non-text media on the Projects are available
        under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of
        allowing unrestricted re-use and re-distribution. When you contribute
        non-text media, you agree to comply with the requirements for such
        licenses as described in our <a href="https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Resolution:Licensing_policy"

          title="Resolution:Licensing policy">Licensing Policy</a>, and also
        comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature
        to which you are contributing.</li>
      <li>
        <b>No revocation of license:</b> Except as consistent with your license,
        you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of
        any license that you have granted under these Terms of Service for text
        content or non-text media contributed to the ${product} Projects or
        features, even if you terminate use of our services.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Public domain content:</b> Content that is in the public domain is
        welcome! It is important however that you confirm the public domain
        status of the content under the law of the European Union as well as the
        laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition.
        When you contribute content that is in the public domain, you warrant
        that the material is actually in the public domain, and you agree to
        label it appropriately.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Re-use:</b> Re-use of content that we host is welcome, though
        exceptions exist for content contributed under "fair use" or similar
        exemptions under copyright law. Any re-use must comply with the
        underlying license(s).
        <p>When you re-use or re-distribute a text page developed by the ${product}
          community, you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following
          fashions:</p>
        <ol style="list-style:lower-roman">
          <li>
            Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that
            you are re-using (since each page has a history page that lists all
            authors and editors);</li>
          <li>
            Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable

            equivalent to the credit given on the Project website; or</li>
          <li>
            Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of
            authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant
            contributions).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the text content was imported from another source, it is possible
          that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but
          not GFDL (as described in â€œImporting text,â€� above). In that case, you
          agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have
          the option to re-license it under GFDL. To determine the license that
          applies to the content that you seek to re-use or re-distribute, you
          should review the page footer, page history, and discussion page.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, please be aware that text that originated from external
          sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that
          attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate
          these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the
          Project, such requirements may appear for example in a banner or other
          notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally
          published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations, re-users
          should preserve them.
        </p>
        For any non-text media, you agree to comply with whatever license under
        which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by
        clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its
        description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work).
        When re-using any content that we host, you agree to comply with the
        relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying
        license or licenses.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Modifications or additions to material that you re-use:</b> When
        modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a
        Project website, you agree to license the modified or added content
        under CC BY-SA 3.0 or later (or, as explained above, another license
        when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature).
        <p>When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you
          have obtained from a Project website, you agree to license the
          modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under
          which the work has been made available.</p>
        With both text content and non-text media, you agree to clearly indicate
        that the original work has been modified. If you are re-using text
        content in a wiki, it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that
        you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified
        version that you distribute, you agree to include a licensing notice
        stating which license the work is released under, along with either a
        hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license
        itself.</li>

    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="8._DMCA_Compliance">8. DMCA Compliance</span></h2>
    <p>The ${product} wants to ensure that the content that we host can be re-used
      by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the
      proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users, as well as to
      other creators and copyright holders, our policy is to respond to notices
      of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital
      Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate,
      in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and
      network who are repeat infringers.
    </p>
    <p>However, we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in
      good faith. In such cases, we strongly encourage users to file
      counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown
      demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you
      think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed, you may wish to consult the
      <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.chillingeffects.org/">Chilling
        Effects</a> website.
    </p>
    <p>If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of
      the Projects without your permission, you may request that the content be
      removed under the DMCA. To make such a request, please email us at <b>info</b><span

    <p>Alternatively, you may make a request to our community, which often
      handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than prescribed under
      the DMCA. In that case, you can post a notice explaining your copyright
      concerns. For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant

    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="10._Management_of_Websites">10. Management
        of Websites</span></h2>
    <p>The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies
      applying to the different Project editions. At the ${product}, we rarely
      intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement. In an
      unusual case, the need may arise, or the community may ask us, to address
      an especially problematic user because of significant Project disturbance
      or dangerous behavior. In such cases, we reserve the right, but do not
      have the obligation to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Investigate your use of the service (a) to determine whether a
        violation of these Terms of Service, Project edition policy, or other
        applicable law or policy has occurred, or (b) to comply with any
        applicable law, legal process, or appropriate governmental request;</li>
      <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical
        issues or respond to user support requests;</li>
      <li>Refuse, disable, or restrict access to the contribution of any user
        who violates these Terms of Service;</li>
      <li>Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or
        access for actions violating these Terms of Service, including repeat

      <li>Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Service

        facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights, property,
        and safety of ourselves and our users, licensors, partners, and the

    </ul>
    <p>In the interests of our users and the Projects, in the extreme
      circumstance that any individual has had his or her account or access
      blocked under this provision, he or she is prohibited from creating or
      using another account on or seeking access to the same Project, unless we
      provide explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the
      community, the ${product} itself will not ban a user from editing or
      contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good
      faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these
      Terms of Service or community policies.
    </p>
    <p>The ${product} community and its members may also take action when so allowed
      by the community or Platform policies applicable to the specific Project
      edition, including but not limited to warning, investigating, blocking, or
      banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the
      final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the
      community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration
      committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the
      policy of the specific Project edition.
    </p>
    <p>Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on
      multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project
      editions. In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Service,
      policies established by the community, which may cover a single Project
      edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy), may be
      modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures.
    </p>
    <p>The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this
      provision shall be in accordance with Section 12 of these Terms of
      Service.

      time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular
      Project or Project edition, and, when they are, you agree to abide by them
      as applicable.
    </p>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="12._Termination">12. Termination</span></h2>
    <p>Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects,
      you can stop using our services any time. In certain (hopefully unlikely)
      circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the ${product}
      community or its members (as described in Section 10) to terminate part or
      all of our services, terminate these Terms of Service, block your account
      or access, or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or
      otherwise terminated for any reason, your public contributions will remain
      publicly available (subject to applicable policies), and, unless we notify
      you otherwise, you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose
      of reading publicly available content on the Projects. In such
      circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or
      settings. We reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time,
      with or without cause, and with or without notice. Even after your use and
      participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of
      Service will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions,
      including Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9-15, and 17.

          Disputes and Jurisdiction</span></h2>
      <p><i>Highlighted for emphasis</i>
      </p>
      <p>We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you, but, in the
        event there is a dispute, we encourage you to seek resolution through
        the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the ${product}.
        If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and
        resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in the
        Netherlands. You also agree that the laws of the State of California
        and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the European Union will
        govern these Terms of Service, as well as any legal claim that might
        arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws
        principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and
        agree that venue is proper in, the courts located in San Francisco
        County, California, in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or
        these Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p>To ensure that disputes are dealt with soon after they arise, you agree
        that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or
        cause of action you might have arising out of or related to use of our
        services or these Terms of Service must be filed within the applicable
        statute of limitations or, if earlier, one (1) year after the pertinent
        facts underlying such claim or cause of action could have been
        discovered with reasonable diligence (or be forever barred).

      <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="14._Disclaimers">14. Disclaimers</span></h2>
      <p><i>Highlighted for emphasis</i>
      </p>
      <p>At the ${product}, we do our best to provide educational and informational
        content to a very wide audience, but your use of our services is at your

      <p>We are not responsible for the content, data, or actions of third
        parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and
        agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or
        in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third

      </p>
      <p>Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through your use of our
        services is done at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely
        responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that
        results from the download of any such material. You agree that we have
        no responsibility or liability for the deletion of, or the failure to

        service. We retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our
        sole discretion at any time with or without notice.
      </p>
      <p>Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the types of disclaimers in
        this section, so they may not apply to you either in part or in full
        depending on the law.
      </p>
      <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="15._Limitation_on_Liability">15.
          Limitation on Liability</span></h2>
      <p><i>Highlighted for emphasis</i>
      </p>
      The ${product} will not be liable to you or to any other party for any direct,
      indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages,
      including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use,
      data, or other intangible losses, regardless of whether we were advised of
      the possibility of such damage. In the case that applicable law may not
      allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or incidental or
      consequential damages, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
      you, although our liability will be limited to the fullest extent
      permitted by applicable law.</div>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="16._Modifications_to_these_Terms_of_Use">16.
        Modifications to these Terms of Service</span></h2>
    <p>Just as the ${product} community's input is essential for the growth and
      maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential
      for these Terms of Service to properly serve our users. It is also
      essential for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of
      Service, as well as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of
      Service, to the community for comment at least thirty (30) days before the
      end of the comment period. If a future proposed revision is substantial,
      we will provide an additional 30 days for comments after posting a
      translation of the proposed revision in at least three languages (selected
      at our discretion). The community will be encouraged to translate the
      proposed revision in other languages as appropriate. For changes for legal
      or administrative reasons, to correct an inaccurate statement, or changes
      in response to community comments, we will provide at least three (3)
      days' notice.
    </p>
    <p>Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Service from time to
      time, we will provide notice of such modifications. However, we ask that
      you please periodically review the most up-to-date version of these Terms
      of Service. Your continued use of our services after the new Terms of
      Service become official following the notice and review period constitutes
      an acceptance of these Terms of Service on your part. For the protection
      of the ${product} Platform and other users like yourself, if you do not agree
      with our Terms of Service, you cannot use our services.
    </p>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="17._Other_Terms">17. Other Terms</span></h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service do not create an employment, agency, partnership,
      or joint venture relationship between you and us, the ${product} Platform. If
      you have not signed a separate agreement with us, these Terms of Service
      are the entire agreement between you and us. If there is any conflict
      between these Terms of Service and a signed written agreement between you
      and us, the signed agreement will control.
    </p>
    <p>You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding
      changes to the Terms of Service, by email, regular mail, or postings on
      Project websites.
    </p>
    <p>If in any circumstance, we do not apply or enforce any provision of these
      Terms of Service, it is not a waiver of that provision.
    </p>
    <p>You understand that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by us, you
      have no expectation of compensation for any activity, contribution, or
      idea that you provide to us, the community, or the ${product} Projects or
      Project editions.
    </p>
    <p>Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms of Service,
      we (the ${product} Platform) and you agree not to modify the applicable terms
      and requirements of any free license that is employed on the Projects or
      Project editions when such free license is authorized by these Terms of
      Service.
    </p>
    <p>These Terms of Service were written in English (U.S.). While we hope that
      translations of these Terms of Service are accurate, in the event of any
      differences in meaning between the original English version and a
      translation, the original English version takes precedence.
    </p>
    <p>If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Service is
      found unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the
      provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Service and will be
      enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and all other provisions of
      these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect.
